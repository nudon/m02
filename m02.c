//so, m02. Goal is to somehow get a basic topdown view going
//basic controls, have some image as a background
//additionally, having some other animate creatures

//kind of unhappy with how text entry is working out
//mostly realized that anytime I have a different kind of input I need a new state
//believe it's better to have substates. where the action from m02 is the same
//but somewhere down the line menuInput sees the substate and goes to the correct handler
//


//done with that, next thing that would be nice is get a map editor going

//also, thought about how I would implement traveling between zones.
//Essentially I'd have some additional fields on tiles, usually set to null
//would contain another tile_map_t, which it would travel to, and also a tile positio to load to
//on input, or maybe automatically, would load the map and set position as specified

//other things to do, get basic animation working. This means setting up sprite sheets
//and also updating draw functions to iterate over the correct sprite cycle. might need more flags

//putting map sections on the backlog of the backlog.
//For now implementation goal is just have npc's perform a fixed amount of naive maze solving guesses per loop

//also, look into storing/reading maps to/from files. Or if not maps, at least specific information, for stuff like saves

//also maybe start playing around with what items should be.

//had some ideas about how to implement depth for items whose sprites extend beyond a single tile
//essentially just draw items from top row to bottom. Also, modify npc drawing
//go through npcList, shove each npc into a list respective to which row they are on
//draw these appropriately with the items. Should rudimently simulate depth

//rework things to access globals to functions, or take them as parameters.

//get a better menu system going. Have an okay basic nesting setup. But ideally I would have it be fancier
//like allow submenus, basically have some way of dividing a menu into rectangles, each of those contain menues
