# m02

My basic top-down game-engine prototype made in c using using SDL2. 

Allows for the creation and manipulation of tile-based maps, and the ability to load and save maps to disk

Not a whole lot else, mostly just a large combination of prototypes of basic game logic, menu systems, and an ill-thought out foray into making my own markup language for maps

Requires that sdl2 be installed
To compile, just invoke make. 

to run, ./m02

beyond that, pressing escape opens up a menu. 
will likely need to create a media dir for storing images
throwing in some pictures called "white.png" and "black.png" would be a good start
